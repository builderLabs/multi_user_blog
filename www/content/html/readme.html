<p><strong>WELCOME</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to The Cogwheel Blog!</p>
<p>Blog articles on the site may be read by anyone regardless of registration and/or logged-in status.</p>
<p>To make full use of the functionality of the site, you must be a registered user<br />
and logged-in to a given session. Registering and logging allow user functions<br />
such as posting/editing/deleting blog posts and comments as well as voting blog<br />
posts up or down.</p>
<p>When not logged in, you may browse and read posts on the main page and/or click<br />
on individual posts to render and read that specific article.</p>
<p>Comments are viewable only by logged-in users and voting functionality<br />
is similarly restricted to logged-in users only.</p>
<p><strong>REGISTRATION</strong></p>
<p>In order to register on the site, simply click the 'register' button. You will<br />
be directed to a register form in which you must enter your username and<br />
password. An email address is optional.</p>
<p>Usernames and passwords must be at least 3 characters long and passwords are<br />
verified during registration with a second password entry to ensure it matches<br />
the first one. If provided, a valid email address is also checked for validity.</p>
<p>Errors on this page will be raised to alert the user to one or more of the<br />
following conditions:<br />
1). Invalid logon<br />
2). Passwords not matching<br />
3). Invalid email address<br />
4). User already exists</p>
<p><strong>LOGGING IN</strong></p>
<p>If you have already registered, you may simply click the 'login' button in the<br />
top menu to log into a session.</p>
<p>Enter your username and password in the log in menu.</p>
<p>Possible errors you might encounter here include:<br />
1). No such user exists (in which case, register first!)<br />
2). Invalid login (check your username and password)</p>
<p>Both the register and log-in menus provide for a convenient way to perform the<br />
alternate action, depending on circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>POSTING</strong></p>
<p>You must be registered and log in to post an article.</p>
<p>Once logged-in, the main menu options will be changed to offer:<br />
1). newpost - click this to make a new post. Note that valid articles<br />
require both a subject and content and posts violating this condition<br />
will not be submitted. Once finished, click submit.<br />
2). logout - click this to log out of a session.</p>
<p><strong>EDITING/DELETING POSTS</strong></p>
<p>You may only edit or delete your own posts.</p>
<p>Once logged in, click on a post/article title to be directed to that particular<br />
article. The menu options will change to offer:<br />
1). editpost - click this to edit your post. Note that the requirements of<br />
a valid subject and content will still apply. Click submit at the<br />
bottom when finished editing.<br />
2). delete - click this to delete a post.</p>
<p>Note that editing and deletion options are separated and an error will be raised<br />
to reflect this if you attempt to edit a post to deletion by submitting empty<br />
subject and content entries.</p>
<p>Note that post author and session user credentials are cross-checked for editing<br />
and/or deletion functionality. An error is raised if you attempt to edit or<br />
delete a post that is not your own.</p>
<p><strong>COMMENTING</strong></p>
<p>Commenting functionality is available to logged-in users only.</p>
<p>Comments appear at the end (bottom) of posted articles. You may comment on<br />
anyone's blog post, including your own. Comments are grouped together by blog<br />
post and are presented in descending time-stamped order.</p>
<p>In order to make or add a comment, simply click the 'comment' button at the end<br />
of a particular posting to comment on that particular article.</p>
<p>Unlike posts, comments do not require a subject.</p>
<p><strong>EDITING/DELETING COMMENTS</strong></p>
<p>You may only edit or delete your own comments and an error is raised if your<br />
log-in credentials do not match those of the comment author.</p>
<p>Similar to posts, editing and deletion functionality are separated so you may<br />
not edit a comment to deletion by attempting to provide empty content. Use the<br />
'delete' button to do this, instead.</p>
<p>Comment functionality includes:<br />
1). edit - click this to edit a comment<br />
2). delete - click this to delete a comment.</p>
<p><strong>VOTING</strong></p>
<p>Votes per blog posting/article are viewable to anyone and appear both in the<br />
main page listing all articles as well as in individual article pages.</p>
<p>For each blog post, a green up-arrow in the top left-hand corner above the blog<br />
title will indicate the aggregate number of up votes the post has received<br />
whereas the red down-arrow indicates the aggregate number of down-votes.</p>
<p>Voting is restricted to logged-in users.</p>
<p>In order to vote up or down a post, log-in and simply click either the up arrow<br />
or the down arrow above the post title to indicate your preference.</p>
<p>You may not vote for your own post and you may only vote in the same direction<br />
for a given post once. Changing votes is allowed - thus, if you once down-voted<br />
a post and decided to up-vote it, you may do so. Multiple attempts to vote in<br />
the same direction, however, are not allowed.</p>
<p>The following self-explanatory messages may appear when using voting<br />
functionality:<br />
1). Upvote has been recorded<br />
2). Downvote has been recorded<br />
3). Your like vote has been already registered<br />
4). Your dislike vote has been alredy registered<br />
5). Cannot vote for your own posts!</p>
<p><strong>ENJOY THE BLOG!!</strong></p>
